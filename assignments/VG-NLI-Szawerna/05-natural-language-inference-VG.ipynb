    "##### Problem description, references\n",
    "In this notebook I will, on the basis of Lab 5, explore how SNLI-trained models perform on FRACAS and whether or not fine-tuning them will improve the performance. A more detailed summary can be found at the end of the notebook. Throughout the notebook I will remark on what was sourced from the original Lab 5 notebook or somewhere else; I did contribute to all the parts of the basic Lab 5 though, so it is not strictly only my classmates' work. The references for the lab can be found at the end of the notebook, and I did not use anything besides that except for the FRACAS dataset itself, which is linked later in this cell, as well as a guide on how to access XML files, linked in the appropriate code block.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Research question and thesis statement  \n",
    "+ Does an SNLI-trained BiLSTM model perform well when evaluated on the FRACAS dataset? Does fine-tuning it on FRACAS influence the performance?\n",
    "+ My prediction is that fine-tuning a model trained on SNLI on FRACAS will improve its performance on FRACAS-related tasks. However, the FRACAS dataset is much smaller, so the change may not be drastically big.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Description of the datasets' structure and my changes to the FRACAS dataset\n",
    "*The dataset could not be downloaded in the simplified version, the link did not work; instead, I used [this](https://github.com/sdobnik/computational-semantics/blob/master/assignments/05-natural-language-inference/simple_snli_1.0.zip)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The (simplified) data is organized as follows (tab-separated values):\n",
    "* Column 1: Premise\n",
    "* Column 2: Hypothesis\n",
    "* Column 3: Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also work with the FRACAS dataset from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~wcmac/downloads/fracas.xml). This one accepts the following relations:\n",
    "* yes - equivalent to entailment\n",
    "* no - equivalent to contradiction\n",
    "* unknown - equivalent to neutral (neither entailment nor contradiction can be concluded)\n",
    "* undef - the example is too tricky for an expert to resolve  \n",
    "\n",
    "I will have to transform this dataset into a format that will be easy to work with, replacing their names of judgements with mine. In addition, some of their examples have two or more premises for one hypothesis. According to the dataset decription, one-premise problems constitute around 55% of the dataset, that is 192 problems. While this does slim the dataset down, I cannot do it any other way without combining the multiple premises into one sentence, as the model I am working with only compares two sentences (the hypothesis and the premise), and so the multi-premise problems will have to be excluded. In the end fewer than 192 problems are used, as some of those do not have an answer (undef), and so I excluded them.  \n",

The second step was to fine-tune the same model on a section of the FRACAS dataset, and perform the same evaluation, so that the results could be compared.  \n",

    "The first step in this assignment was transforming the data from the FRACAS dataset into a format that would be similar to what I had in the SNLI dataset. This meant having to decide how to translate the relation labels as well as what to do with the examples that had more than one premise. All of that has been described in section 1 of the assignment.  \n",
    "The second step was to create the model, for which I used the same architecture as in Assignment 5, with the exception of not using the custom max pooling function, as that one was really slow in comparison with the PyTorch one. I did make sure that the PyTorch one was giving me the output I wanted.  \n",
    "The final step was training the model on SNLI and evaluating it, and then fine-tuning it on FRACAS and re-evaluating again. Both of the models have been saved (along with the train_dataset, whose word2idx is used to encode the words in loaders). The results of the evaluation can be seen below:  \n",

    "|-----|-----|-------|-----------|---------|\n",

    "#### Evaluation \n",
    "It can be noticed that the base model (just trained on SNLI) performed better on the SNLI test set, but worse on all of the FRACAS ones. The fine-tuned model (first trained on SNLI, then trained more on FRACAS) performed worse on the SNLI test set, but better on the FRACAS ones. The difference in the peformance on SNLI is not major, and the one on FRACAS is bigger. However, these results are not always consistent when re-running the notebook, and generally oscillate around these values. It seems like fine-tuning on FRACAS has a rather marginal effect.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion\n",
    "However, it is worth noting that the FRACAS dataset is significantly smaller than the SNLI train set. SNLI train has 550k examples, while our FRACAS dev - barely more than 80 (that is not 80k examples, that is 80 examples). This massive disproportion likely makes it so that the FRACAS examples do not contribute nearly as much as the SNLI ones, and perhaps balancing them out better would have been a better idea - this is difficult to do though, given that FRACAS itself is a small dataset. It is interesting to see though that it does have an effect, and on some runs of the notebook at least they do suggest that training a BiLSTM model on multiple kinds of inference datasets could improve its performance in some tasks without sacrificing too much of the performance elsewhere.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, given that we had 4 classes (the '-', 'contradiction', 'entailment', 'neutral' from SNLI), and given that '-' is a very rare one, the \"stupid\" baseline for this model would have been 33%. It performs better than that in all the categories, so I am fairly confident when I say it has learned something that lets it perform NLI - but whether it is something about the meaning or the structure of the data itself, I cannot say for certain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that after fine-tuning, the model performs better on the semantic examples, and worse on the syntactic ones. While the first change wwas expected by me, the second one is rather surprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible future work\n",
    "It would be really interesting to see the results with a more balanced SNLI-to-FRACAS ratio, seeing what the tradeoff is between gaining proficiency in FRACAS tasks and losing it in SNLI ones. It could also be interesting to test the model on other NLI datasets, or just the embeddings on other tasks. Overall I would also be interested in how NLI-based tasks could be used in training bigger, BERT-like models as one of the pre-training tasks, and what kind of meaning they would contribute - as clearly it also depends on the NLI dataset used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final remarks\n",
    "When annotating the notebook for which parts I have done myself and which I have adapted, I felt like I have not done all that much, but I can promise that I did put quite some work into this little project, and hopefully it is sufficient. We have re-used similar elements in all of our neural network labs (e.g. the custom datasets and dataloaders which were initially done by Isac Boström from my group), and this project (and lab 5) is no exception in some of its sections. I found it particularly fun to have to think how to retrieve the FRACAS data and process it so that it would work with the model and the evaluation, and therein lies the most work I put into it. I also had to fix some minor issues with the model/training loop since relative to the draft submission of lab 5 there were some indexing errors when training on the training set. And, naturally, the discussion of the results is entirely mine, as is anything in the code that differs from lab 5 (unless stated otherwise). I hope that this is sufficient for the VG project, as discussed in e-mails before, and in case it is not, or you have any questions, issues, or comments, do not hesitate to contact me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am resubmitting this assignment due to a small mistake that was pointed out in the base version of assignment 5, where we forgot to set batch_first to True when setting our model up. This was changed and while it, surprisingly, did not influence the base model much, it did make a difference for whether the model performed better on semantic or syntactic FRACAS examples."
