According to [https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/pearson-correlation-coefficient-statistical-guide.php] it is in the lower range of small positive association. This means that there is some level of similarity between the gold standard judgements and the word embedding similarities. Since the embedding models are supposed to reflect similarities between words, this is not terribly bad, but naturally the higher the performance, the better. The difference may be due to the kind of data we created our embeddings on or the low number of epochs, but also due to human judgements (which I assume the gold standard to be) taking into account features other than the embeddings do.  \n",

We tested some other sets (10k, 15k) and depending on the size of the embeddings they sometimes also caused those issues. Running them with smaller embeddings or fewer epochs yielded really unsatisfactory results, which is why we are submitting this one where we re-ran the model on 5k and got 66.2% accuracy. It seems like a significant part of how good the model is here is up to us being lucky with the random embeddings at the start. Please do not hesistate to let us know if you want us to try to re-run it with any other data set."

It is a lot of variables and they all can improve (or hurt) the performance of the model.\n",
