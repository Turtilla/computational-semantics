Previously we worked with *static word representations*, i.e. the representation does not depend on the context. To illustrate we can consider sentences (a) and (b), the word **bank** would have the same static representation in both sentences, which means that it becomes difficult for us to predict its sense. What we want is to create representations that depend on the context, i.e. *contextualized embeddings*. \n",

    "\n",
    "To train a neural network, we first need to prepare the data. This involves converting words (and labels) to a number, and organizing the data into batches. We also want the ability to shuffle the examples such that they appear in a random order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do all of this we will use the torchtext library (https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). In addition to converting our data into numerical form and creating batches, it will generate a word and label vocabulary, and data iterators than can sort and shuffle the examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a dataloader for the training and test set you created previously. So, how do we go about doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) First we create a ``Field`` for each of our columns. A field is a function which tokenize the input, keep a dictionary of word-to-numbers, and fix paddings. So, we need four fields, one for the word-sense, one for the position, one for the lemma and one for the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) After we have our fields, we need to process the data. For this we use the ``TabularDataset`` class. We pass the name and path of the training and test files we created previously, then we assign which field to use in each column. The result is that each column will be processed by the field indicated. So, the context column will be tokenized and processed by the context field and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) After we have processed the dataset we need to build the vocabulary, for this we call the function ``build_vocab()`` on the different ``Fields`` with the output from ``TabularDataset`` as input. This looks at our dataset and creates the necessary vocabularies (word-to-number mappings). \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Finally, the last step. In the last step we load the data objects given by the ``TabularDataset`` and pass it to the ``BucketIterator`` class. This class will organize our examples into batches and shuffle them around (such that for each epoch the model observe the examples in a different order). When we are done with this we can let our function return the data iterators and vocabularies, then we are ready to train and test our model!\n",

    "In this section of the lab you'll try out the transformer, specifically the BERT model. For this we'll use the huggingface library (https://huggingface.co/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the documentation for the BERT model here (https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html) and a general usage guide here (https://huggingface.co/transformers/quickstart.html).\n",

    "What we're going to do is *fine-tune* the BERT model, i.e. update the weights of a pre-trained model. That is, we have a model that is trained on language modeling, but now we apply it to word sense disambiguation with the word representations it learnt from language modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the same data splits for training and testing as before, but this time you'll not use a torchtext dataloader. Rather now you create an iterator that collects N sentences (where N is the batch size) then use the BertTokenizer to transform the sentence into integers. For your dataloader, remember to:\n",
    "* Shuffle the data in each batch\n",
    "* Make sure you get a new iterator for each *epoch*\n",
    "* Create a vocabulary of *sense-labels* so you can calculate accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "We then pass this batch into the BERT model and train as before. The BERT model will encode the sentence, then we send this encoded sentence into a prediction layer (you can either the the sentence-representation from bert, or the ambiguous word) like before and collect sense predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the hyperparameters and training:\n",
    "* For BERT, usually a lower learning rate works best, between 0.0001-0.000001.\n",
    "* BERT takes alot of resources, running it on CPU will take ages, utilize the GPUs :)\n",
    "* Since BERT takes alot of resources, use a small batch size (4-8)\n",
    "* Computing the BERT representation, make sure you pass the mask\n",

    "As seen in the code and results below, the trend is not 100% consistent, but it seems like the more senses a given word has, the better the model is at predicting them correctly, which I found to be surprising. It is the words with 10 or 11 forms that have the highest performance (70-80%), although this is by no means fully consistent across the board. I would have expected the words with fewer senses to be better recognized, as there are fewer senses to choose from, ergo, even when randomly selected, there is a higher chance of being correct. However, we always predict from all 222 classes, so that probably influences it. In addition, the words with more senses may be better featured in the data on which the model is fine-tuned, so it is just better at recognizing them."
