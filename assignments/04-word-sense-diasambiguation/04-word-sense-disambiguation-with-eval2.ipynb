    "In case a) and b) we can determine that the meaning of \"bank\" based on the *context*. To utilize context in a semantic model we use *contextualized word representations*. Previously we worked with *static word representations*, i.e. the representation does not depend on the context. To illustrate we can consider sentences (a) and (b), the word **bank** would have the same static representation in both sentences, which means that it becomes difficult for us to predict its sense. What we want is to create representations that depend on the context, i.e. *contextualized embeddings*. \n",

    "\n",
    "To train a neural network, we first need to prepare the data. This involves converting words (and labels) to a number, and organizing the data into batches. We also want the ability to shuffle the examples such that they appear in a random order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do all of this we will use the torchtext library (https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). In addition to converting our data into numerical form and creating batches, it will generate a word and label vocabulary, and data iterators than can sort and shuffle the examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a dataloader for the training and test set you created previously. So, how do we go about doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) First we create a ``Field`` for each of our columns. A field is a function which tokenize the input, keep a dictionary of word-to-numbers, and fix paddings. So, we need four fields, one for the word-sense, one for the position, one for the lemma and one for the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) After we have our fields, we need to process the data. For this we use the ``TabularDataset`` class. We pass the name and path of the training and test files we created previously, then we assign which field to use in each column. The result is that each column will be processed by the field indicated. So, the context column will be tokenized and processed by the context field and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) After we have processed the dataset we need to build the vocabulary, for this we call the function ``build_vocab()`` on the different ``Fields`` with the output from ``TabularDataset`` as input. This looks at our dataset and creates the necessary vocabularies (word-to-number mappings). \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Finally, the last step. In the last step we load the data objects given by the ``TabularDataset`` and pass it to the ``BucketIterator`` class. This class will organize our examples into batches and shuffle them around (such that for each epoch the model observe the examples in a different order). When we are done with this we can let our function return the data iterators and vocabularies, then we are ready to train and test our model!\n",

It is the words with 10 or 11 forms that have the highest performance (70-80%), although this is by no means fully consistent across the board. I would have expected the words with fewer senses to be better recognized, as there are fewer senses to choose from, ergo, even when randomly selected, there is a higher chance of being correct. However, we always predict from all 222 classes, so that probably influences it. In addition, the words with more senses may be better featured in the data on which the model is fine-tuned, so it is just better at recognizing them."

    "LSTMs in this assignment perform worse than BERT. However Approach 2 performed very similarily, which surprised us.\n",
    "The major difference between the two is that for LSTMs we do word embeddings from scratch. This means that we only have a few epochs and limited data to capture the \"meaning\" of the words in the model. In comparison, BERT already has embeddings for a lot of words, and all we need to do is fine tune, or tweak them to fit our task at hand. This means that essentially the meanings of the words are already there, we just need to train the model to classify word senses based on the context.  \n",
    "In terms of purely what we use to get predictions (as explained in the answer to an earlier question), in LSTMs we either get a class prediction for a given index, or we base it on the concatenation of the final hidden states for the left-directional and right-directional LSTM. For BERT we get fine-tuned attention-based output for every element of the sentence, which is then pooled and pushed to a classifier layer, which has been trained to use that input to predict one of the 222 classes/word senses.

    "+ We could combine the two approaches, as suggested in class (use both the index prediction and the final hidden state to predict the word sense).\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT:\n",
    "+ We could test using the initial sentence representation (on the first token) and see if that gives better results than pooling the representations for all the elements. Both are claimed to be rather similar in results, but perhaps it would make a difference.\n",
    "+ Even though we used the suggested hyperparameters perhaps we could also change something there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both:\n",
    "+ We could definitely implement dropout (which we forget to do while developing the models now). This would help counteract potential overfitting.\n",
    "+ For now the models choose, regardless of the word we are predicting the sense of, a class/sense out of 222 available ones. This means that \"keep\" can get not only 'keep%2:41:03::' but also 'force%1:18:00::' predicted. Perhaps it would work better if the classifier could only pick from the word senses applicable for the given word. For now just choosing blindly gives us a 1 in 222 chance of being correct. If we narrow it down, we get a, say, 1 in 4 (to 1 in 11) chance, which is a major change. "
