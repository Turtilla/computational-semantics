The sentences are simple enough for the logical expressions to represent their meanings rather faithfully; the closes to such a problem that I can find are the *Alex is both smart and musical* and *if Alex or George plays the piano, they are musical*. First of all, in the translation we have separate variables for \"Alex is smart\" and \"Alex is musical\" (as well as Alex playing the piano and George playing the piano, Alex being musical, and George being musical). This means that if we translated it back from the logical expression, we would not get the same sentence. Naturally, we could have more variables, but then we would quickly run out of variables (and it would not show the fact that sentences that mention Alex's musicality have something in common in terms of meaning). Secondly, in the second sentence mentioned here we have a diectic element, the pronoun \"they\" - it can be assumed that in that sentence it refers to Alex and George, but without a wider context it is not 100% certain; moreover, again, if translated back from the logical expression, the sentence would not contain that pronoun."
